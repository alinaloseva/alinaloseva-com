# Hello! #

## My name is Alina Loseva. I am a graphic and lettering designer from Russia, based in Barcelona. I believe any complex ideas should be shown in a beautiful and accessible way. ##
I have a vast experience over 13 years in different studios and as a freelancer working as art director, graphic designer and doing pre-press. I have a&nbsp; bachelor degree in Graphic Design and Visual Communications (HASGD, Moscow 2009), Master degree in Branding and packaging (IDEP Barcelona, 2013), Master in Typography Design (EINA, Barcelona, 2014). I always tend to keep studying and exploring new things inside our beautiful endless world.
