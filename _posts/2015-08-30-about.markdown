# Hello! #

## My name is Alina Loseva. I am a visual artist currently based in Barcelona. I believe any complex ideas should be shown in a beautiful and accessible way. ##
I've been creating things for over 13 years, collaborating with cool studios and working on my own as an art-director and a visual designer. I have a&nbsp; bachelor degree in Graphic Design and Visual Communications (HASGD, Moscow 2009), Master degree in Branding and packaging (IDEP Barcelona, 2013), Master in Typography Design (EINA, Barcelona, 2014). I always keep studying and exploring new things inside our beautiful endless world.
